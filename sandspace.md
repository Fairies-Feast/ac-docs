[Home](index.html)

In this templates, we will run Python in the browser with Amsilla Code and Pyodide!

## Step 1 - Open your Sandspace
Navigate to [Amsilla Code](https://fairies-feast.github.io). Then, press the "New" tab in the navigation bar. Then, press Sandspace.

## Step 2 - Input your code
Click the big rectangle in the middle of the screen and delete all of its contents. Then, type the code you wish to run.

## Step 3 - Install dependencies
If you have any packages you want to install, put them in the input that says "Packages to Install", seperated by a single space.

## Step 4 - Run
Press the "Run" button. The button should automatically install your dependencies and will run the code in the rectangle. The output will display on your screen.
To scroll, use the outer scrollbar.
